	KulkiEx is a logic game. During the game you move the balls in that way they will create a line. If the line is made from at least five balls it is removed from game field. In case when movement does not end with strike there are added three balls in random colors and positions. Your goal is to try to create lines in each movement. For each striked ball you get suitable number of points. The games ends when you cannot make any move.
